See the license [here](https://github.com/pascalandy/GNU-GENERAL-PUBLIC-LICENSE/blob/master/LICENSE.md).


## Why forking this license?

**First**, I wanted a clean **Markdown** version of the license.

**Second**, no matter how I trust the open source community, **I feel it’s not best practice** to: 

1. Use a link that points to a licence written by a third party
2. Use licence(s) proposed by GitHub

If any changes happen, how do you know it's still right for you? By using scenario #1 or #2, you could put yourself in a position where you may lose the control of what the licence was supposed to mean at the moment you read it.

I believe everyone should fork the licence they want to use on their own repos. The one I use is [here](https://github.com/pascalandy/GNU-GENERAL-PUBLIC-LICENSE/blob/master/LICENSE).

#### 2) Plain english explanation by the GNU's creator

Watch Richard Stallman explains the idea.
